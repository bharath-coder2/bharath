      <h2>PORSCHEvolution</h2>
      <p>
         Parallax scrolling websites are a great way to tell a story, including one that's unfolded over many decades. The PORSCHEvolution site shows how Porsche cards have evolved, from the Type 64 Racing Coupé of the 1930s to the 2021 911. Created by UX designer Ondrej Homola, the parallax scrolling is super smooth, and it's made even more engaging through the soundtrack – Daft Punk reimagined for every decade since the 1930s

        <h2> Qode catalogue</h2>
        <p>
           The Qode Interactive Catalogue begins with parallax scrolling in the intro. Scroll past that, and you reach a stylised menu that reveals an image when each WordPress theme name is scrolled over. Clicking on the name of each theme then takes you to a scrolling portfolio of example applications that showcase its design possibilities. 
           It's not the most ground-breaking use of parallax scrolling in this list, but it shows how the technique can be used for a clear purpose and to enhance the user experience. Through parallax scrolling, Qode efficiently showcases a range of applications for each theme in a way that makes an impact. A scattering of animation is also used to good effect on this site.

      <h2>Moooi</h2>
      <p>
        Moooi's parallax scrolling website shows how the technique can add even more impact to already bold designs. It uses the technique to allow uses to scroll through its furniture collections as if they were exhibits in a museum, each with their own title screen. Additional parallax scrolling effects on the staging of each collection creates a striking sense of depth and movement. You can then click to see the moodboard for each set.
